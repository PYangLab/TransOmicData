# TransOmicData

The TransOmicsData package contains datasets spanning various biological contexts such as in vitro embryonic and tissue-specific development in mouse and human. It covers multiple omics sequencing technologies such as RNAseq, mass spectrometry and ChIP-seq. This package was developed to provide convenient access to raw or pre-processed data for comparative trans-omics analysis.
